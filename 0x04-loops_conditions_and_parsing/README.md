# 0x04 - Loops, conditions and parsing

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* How to create SSH keys
* What is the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`
* How to use `while`, `until` and `for` loops
* How to use `if`, `else`, `elif` and `case` condition statements
* How to use the `cut` command
* What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them
